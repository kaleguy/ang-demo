# Angular + FullCalendar Demo

[Live Demo Site](https://safe-retreat-49267.herokuapp.com/)

This is a test project for displaying event data in FullCalendar via an Angular app. It is based
on the HotTowel starter app.


**Forked from HotTowel Angular**

To install the original Hot Towel project, see Hottowel on yeoman. The original project contains
documentation about various aspects of the code. This version just adds the FullCalendar control
with a few enhancements.

The files added for the calendar are under src - client - app - calendar.

The added code is ES6, compliled to ES5 with Babel (in the '.compiled' files).

>*Hot Towel is based on the Opinionated Angular style guide for teams by [@john_papa](//twitter.com/john_papa)*
